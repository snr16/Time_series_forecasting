## **Walmart Sales Forecasting**

### **Overview**
This project focuses on forecasting Walmart's sales using time series analysis techniques. The dataset contains weekly sales data, and the analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and time series modeling.

### **Project Objectives**
- Load and clean the dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Conduct time series decomposition.
- Analyze autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.
- Build and evaluate forecasting models.

### **Installation**
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn
```

### **Usage**
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook walmart_sales_forecasting.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, visualize trends, and perform time series modeling.

### **Key Techniques Used**
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Splitting data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Using ACF and PACF plots to determine optimal lags.
- **Forecasting Models**: Implementing ARIMA, SARIMA, or other time series models.

### **Results & Insights**
- Identified key trends and seasonal patterns in Walmartâ€™s sales.
- Determined the optimal lag (`m`) for seasonal modeling based on ACF/PACF.
- Built predictive models to forecast future sales.


### **License**
This project is open-source and free to use.
